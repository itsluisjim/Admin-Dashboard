# Admin-Dashboard

The project I have completed involved the creation of an admin dashboard using HTML and CSS. This was done as part of my participation in The Odin Project course, with the aim of familiarizing myself with advanced concepts like flexbox and grid.

Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies and nuances of these layout techniques, and have been able to hone my skills in designing user interfaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. By utilizing these powerful tools, I have been able to create a dashboard that is both visually striking and highly intuitive, with a layout that is optimized for ease of use and maximum productivity.

Overall, this project has been an invaluable learning experience for me, and I am confident that the skills and knowledge I have gained through it will serve me well in my future endeavors in web development and UI design.
